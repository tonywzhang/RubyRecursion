# Recursion Homework
For tonight's exercises, we are going to write several recursive functions. Here's how you should approach each problem:

Read the problem statement to make sure you fully understand the problem
1. Identify the base case(s)
2. Determine the inductive step
3. Write the function
4. Run the provided test cases to verify you have a working solution
As we learn recursion, it is important that we break down each problem into these steps. Doing so will help us devise solutions and avoid stack overflow errors.

If you encounter strange bugs or errors, use byebug!
